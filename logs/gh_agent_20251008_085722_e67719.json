Here are steps you can follow based on the search results:\n\n1. **Set up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):\n   - Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv env\n     ```\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     - On macOS and Linux:\n       ```bash\n       source env/bin/activate\n       ```\n     - On Windows:\n       ```bash\n       env\\Scripts\\activate\n       ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   - You can use either `kafka-python` or `confluent-kafka`. Here are the commands for both:\n   - For `kafka-python`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install kafka-python\n     ```\n   - For `confluent-kafka`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install confluent-kafka\n     ```\n   - If you are working with Avro, also install `fastavro`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install fastavro\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for Modules**: If you encounter a \"Module not found\" error, make sure you have installed the required packages and activated your virtual environment. \n\n4. **Run Your Python Scripts**: Once your environment is set and dependencies installed, you can run your Kafka producer or consumer scripts.\n\nFor detailed commands and troubleshooting steps, you can refer to the following snippets:\n- [Error while running python3 stream.py worker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-6/006_44cc6eaa10_error-while-running-python3-streampy-worker.md)\n- [Installing dependencies for python Kafka](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-6/021_2763850d3e_python-kafka-installing-dependencies-for-python3-0.md)\n- [Resolving Module 'kafka' not found error](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/_questions/data-engineering-zoomcamp/module-6/003_a1ea959c7e_module-kafka-not-found-when-trying-to-run-producer.md)\n\nMake sure your Docker containers or any service dependencies required by Kafka are also running when you execute your scripts.",
