          "content": "The documentation did not provide specific information on running Kafkaesque with Python. However, I can provide general guidance on how to use Kafka with Python.\n\n### Running Kafka with Python\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   First, you need to install the Kafka client for Python. The most commonly used package is `kafka-python`. You can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install kafka-python\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up Kafka**:\n   Make sure you have a Kafka broker running. You can download Kafka from the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads). Start the broker by following the instructions provided in the Kafka documentation.\n\n3. **Producing Messages**:\n   Here\u2019s a simple example of a Kafka producer:\n   ```python\n   from kafka import KafkaProducer\n\n   producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')\n   producer.send('my_topic', b'Hello, Kafka!')\n   producer.flush()\n   ```\n\n4. **Consuming Messages**:\n   And here\u2019s how you can consume messages:\n   ```python\n   from kafka import KafkaConsumer\n\n   consumer = KafkaConsumer('my_topic', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')\n   for message in consumer:\n       print(f\"Received message: {message.value}\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Running the Script**:\n   You can run your Python scripts that act as producers or consumers from the command line.\n\n### Additional Resources\nFor more detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the [kafka-python documentation](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n\nIf you need more specialized help regarding Kafkaesque, it's possible that some specific usage information is not included in the provided documentation. In that case, consider checking official Kafka or Kafkaesque documentation online or relevant community forums.",
