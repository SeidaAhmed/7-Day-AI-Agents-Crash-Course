# 7-Day-AI-Agents-Email-Crash-Course

This repo is about my 7-Day AI Agent Crash Course

In this course, I will build a conversational AI agent that can answer questions about any GitHub repository. It acts as a personal assistant for code and documentation, similar to DeepWiki but tailored to my own repositories.

The process involves:

Downloading and processing data from the repository

Indexing it in a search engine

Connecting the search engine to the agent

In the first half of the course, I focus on preparing the data.
